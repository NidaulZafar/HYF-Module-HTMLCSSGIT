## Data types: 
var can have different data types. 
1.      number - besides regular numbers and arithmetic operations, other "special numerical values" 
also exist" like Infinity, -infinity and NaN
 alert( 1 / 0 ); // Infinity 
 alert(Infinity ); // Infinity 
 alert( "not a number" / 2 ); // NaN, such division is erroneous 
2.      bigInt add n after the number 
3.      String
     let str = "Hello";
    let str2 = 'Single quotes are ok too';
     let phrase = `can embed another ${str}`; 
     
     or
     
      let name = "John"; 
      // embed a variable
       alert( `Hello, ${name}!`); // Hello, John! // 
    embed an expression
     alert( `the result is ${1 + 2}` );  // the result is 3

      // alert("I'm Javascript");  (to give an alert in the browser)

      //       let user = "John";
      //       age = 25;
      //       message = "hello";
      //       alert(user);
      //       alert(age);
      //       alert(message);

      // let name = "John";
      // let admin = name;
      // alert(admin);
4.      Boolean (true or false)
let nameFieldChecked = true; // yes, name field is checked
let ageFieldChecked = false; // no, age field is not checked

or comparisons 

let isGreater = 4 > 1;

alert( isGreater ); // true (the comparison result is "yes")


5.      null
represents nothing, empty or unknown

6.      undefined
let age;

alert(age); // shows "undefined"

7. Objects and symbols
used to store collections of data and more complex entities.
symbol type is used to create unique identifiers for objects.

8. typeof

typeof undefined // "undefined"

typeof 0 // "number"

typeof 10n // "bigint"

typeof true // "boolean"

typeof "foo" // "string"

typeof Symbol("id") // "symbol"

typeof Math // "object" 

typeof null // "object"  (2)

typeof alert // "function" 


## Interaction
(alert , prompt, confirm)

alert
shows a message.
alert("Hello");



prompt
shows a message asking the user to input text. It returns the text or, if Cancel button or Esc is clicked, null.
syntax: result = prompt(title, [default]);

example:
let age = prompt('How old are you?', 100);
alert(`You are ${age} years old!`); // You are 100 years old!


confirm
shows a message and waits for the user to press “OK” or “Cancel”. It returns true for OK and false for Cancel/Esc.
syntax: result = confirm(question);

example:
let isBoss = confirm("Are you the boss?");
alert( isBoss ); // true if OK is pressed


All these methods are modal: they pause script execution and don’t allow the visitor to interact with the rest of the page until the window has been dismissed.
There are two limitations shared by all the methods above:
The exact location of the modal window is determined by the browser. Usually, it’s in the center.
The exact look of the window also depends on the browser. We can’t modify it.

##Type COnversions

###String Conversions
let value = true;
alert(typeof value); // boolean

value = String(value); // now value is converted to a string "true"
alert(typeof value); // string

###Number conversions
1.    let num = Number(str); // converted to number 123
      alert(typeof num); // number

2.    alert( "6" / "2" ); // 3, strings are automatically converted to numbers

alert( Number("   123   ") ); // 123
alert( Number("123z") );      // NaN (error reading a number at "z")
alert( Number(true) );        // 1
alert( Number(false) );       // 0

###Boolean conversions
Boolean(value)

Values that are intuitively “empty”, like 0, an empty string, null, undefined, and NaN, become false.
Other values become true. For instance:

alert( Boolean(1) ); // true
alert( Boolean(0) ); // false
alert( Boolean("hello") ); // true
alert( Boolean("") ); // false


##Maths

Remainder %
alert( 5 % 2 ); // 1, a remainder of 5 divided by 2
alert( 8 % 3 ); // 2, a remainder of 8 divided by 3

Exponentiation **
The exponentiation operator a ** b raises a to the power of b.

In school maths, we write that as 2². For instance:
alert( 2 ** 2 ); // 2² = 4
alert( 2 ** 3 ); // 2³ = 8
alert( 2 ** 4 ); // 2⁴ = 16


Just like in maths, the exponentiation operator is defined for non-integer numbers as well.
For example, a square root is an exponentiation by ½:

alert( 4 ** (1/2) ); // 2 (power of 1/2 is the same as a square root)
alert( 8 ** (1/3) ); // 2 (power of 1/3 is the same as a cubic root)

###   String concatenation with binary +
Usually, the plus operator + sums numbers. But, if the binary + is applied to strings, it merges (concatenates) them:

let s = "my" + "string";
alert(s); // mystring
Note that if any of the operands is a string, then the other one is converted to a string too. For example:

alert( '1' + 2 ); // "12"
alert( 2 + '1' ); // "21"
See, it doesn’t matter whether the first operand is a string or the second one.

Here’s a more complex example:
alert(2 + 2 + '1' ); // "41" and not "221"
Here, operators work one after another. The first + sums two numbers, so it returns 4,
then the next + adds the string 1 to it, so it’s like 4 + '1' = '41'.

alert('1' + 2 + 2); // "122" and not "14"
Here, the first operand is a string, the compiler treats the other two operands as strings too. 
The 2 gets concatenated to '1', so it’s like '1' + 2 = "12" and "12" + 2 = "122".

The binary + is the only operator that supports strings in such a way. 
Other arithmetic operators work only with numbers and always convert their operands to numbers.
Here’s the demo for subtraction and division:

alert( 6 - '2' ); // 4, converts '2' to a number
alert( '6' / '2' ); // 3, converts both operands to numbers

###   Numeric conversion, unary +
applied to a single value, doesn’t do anything to numbers. But if the operand is not a number, the unary plus converts it into a number.
For example:

// No effect on numbers
let x = 1;
alert( +x ); // 1
let y = -2;
alert( +y ); // -2

// Converts non-numbers
alert( +true ); // 1
alert( +"" );   // 0
It actually does the same thing as Number(...), but is shorter.

The need to convert strings to numbers arises very often.
For example, if we are getting values from HTML form fields, they are usually strings. What if we want to sum them?

The binary plus would add them as strings:

let apples = "2";
let oranges = "3";

alert( apples + oranges ); // "23", the binary plus concatenates strings
If we want to treat them as numbers, we need to convert and then sum them:

let apples = "2";
let oranges = "3";

// both values converted to numbers before the binary plus
alert( +apples + +oranges ); // 5

// the longer variant
// alert( Number(apples) + Number(oranges) ); // 5

## Assignment (=)
###   Chaining assignments
Another interesting feature is the ability to chain assignments:

let a, b, c;

a = b = c = 2 + 2;

alert( a ); // 4
alert( b ); // 4
alert( c ); // 4
Chained assignments evaluate from right to left. First, the rightmost expression 2 + 2 is evaluated and then assigned to the variables 
on the left: c, b and a. At the end, all the variables share a single value.

Once again, for the purposes of readability it’s better to split such code into few lines:

c = 2 + 2;
b = c;
a = c;

###   Modify-in-place
We often need to apply an operator to a variable and store the new result in that same variable.

For example:
let n = 2;
n = n + 5;
n = n * 2;
This notation can be shortened using the operators += and *=:

let n = 2;
n += 5; // now n = 7 (same as n = n + 5)
n *= 2; // now n = 14 (same as n = n * 2)

alert( n ); // 14

avlbl for all +  -  *  /
Such operators have the same precedence as a normal assignment, so they run after most other calculations:
let n = 2;
n *= 3 + 5;
alert( n ); // 16  (right part evaluated first, same as n *= 8)

###   Increment/decrement
Increasing or decreasing a number by one is among the most common numerical operations.

So, there are special operators for it:

Increment ++ increases a variable by 1:

let counter = 2;
counter++;        // works the same as counter = counter + 1, but is shorter
alert( counter ); // 3
Decrement -- decreases a variable by 1:

let counter = 2;
counter--;        // works the same as counter = counter - 1, but is shorter
alert( counter ); // 1
Important:
Increment/decrement can only be applied to variables. Trying to use it on a value like 5++ will give an error.

The operators ++ and -- can be placed either before or after a variable.

When the operator goes after the variable, it is in “postfix form”: counter++.
The “prefix form” is when the operator goes before the variable: ++counter.
Both of these statements do the same thing: increase counter by 1.

Is there any difference? Yes, but we can only see it if we use the returned value of ++/--.
Let’s clarify. As we know, all operators return a value. Increment/decrement is no exception. 
The prefix form returns the new value while the postfix form returns the old value (prior to increment/decrement).

To see the difference, here’s an example:
let counter = 1;
let a = ++counter; // (*)
alert(a); // 2
In the line (*), the prefix form ++counter increments counter and returns the new value, 2. So, the alert shows 2.

Now, let’s use the postfix form:
let counter = 1;
let a = counter++; // (*) changed ++counter to counter++
alert(a); // 1
In the line (*), the postfix form counter++ also increments counter but returns the old value (prior to increment). So, the alert shows 1.

To summarize:
If the result of increment/decrement is not used, there is no difference in which form to use:
let counter = 0;
counter++;
++counter;
alert( counter ); // 2, the lines above did the same

If we’d like to increase a value and immediately use the result of the operator, we need the prefix form:
let counter = 0;
alert( ++counter ); // 1

If we’d like to increment a value but use its previous value, we need the postfix form:
let counter = 0;
alert( counter++ ); // 0

Increment/decrement among other operators
The operators ++/-- can be used inside expressions as well. Their precedence is higher than most other arithmetical operations.
For instance:
let counter = 1;
alert( 2 * ++counter ); // 4
Compare with:
let counter = 1;
alert( 2 * counter++ ); // 2, because counter++ returns the "old" value
Though technically okay, such notation usually makes code less readable. One line does multiple things – not good.
While reading code, a fast “vertical” eye-scan can easily miss something like counter++ and it won’t be obvious that the variable increased.
We advise a style of “one line – one action”:

let counter = 1;
alert( 2 * counter );
counter++;

Bitwise operators and Comma 
Rare, so no details yet


##    Conditional branching: if, '?'
let year = prompt('In which year was ECMAScript-2015 specification published?', '');
if (year == 2015) alert( 'You are right!' );

If we want to execute more than one statement, we have to wrap our code block inside curly braces:
if (year == 2015) {
  alert( "That's correct!" );
  alert( "You're so smart!" );
}

We recommend wrapping your code block with curly braces {} every time you use an if statement, 
even if there is only one statement to execute. Doing so improves readability.

## If else example
let year = prompt(
        "In which year was the ECMAScript-2015 specification published?",
        ""
      );

      if (year == 2015) {
        alert("You guessed it right!");
      } else {
        alert("How can you be so wrong?"); // any value except 2015
      }

## else if example

let year = prompt('In which year was the ECMAScript-2015 specification published?', '');

if (year < 2015) {
  alert( 'Too early...' );
} else if (year > 2015) {
  alert( 'Too late' );
} else {
  alert( 'Exactly!' );
}

##    Conditional operator ‘?’
Sometimes, we need to assign a variable depending on a condition.
For instance:

let accessAllowed;
let age = prompt('How old are you?', '');
if (age > 18) {
  accessAllowed = true;
} else {
  accessAllowed = false;
}
alert(accessAllowed);

The so-called “conditional” or “question mark” operator lets us do that in a shorter and simpler way.

The operator is represented by a question mark ?. Sometimes it’s called “ternary”, because the operator has three operands. 
It is actually the one and only operator in JavaScript which has that many.

The syntax is:
let result = condition ? value1 : value2;
The condition is evaluated: if it’s truthy then value1 is returned, otherwise – value2.

For example:
let accessAllowed = (age > 18) ? true : false;
Technically, we can omit the parentheses around age > 18. The question mark operator has a low precedence, 
so it executes after the comparison >.
let accessAllowed = age > 18 ? true : false;
But parentheses make the code more readable, so we recommend using them.

Please note:
In the example above, you can avoid using the question mark operator because the comparison itself returns true/false:

// the same
let accessAllowed = age > 18;


Multiple ‘?’
A sequence of question mark operators ? can return a value that depends on more than one condition.
For instance:
let age = prompt('age?', 18);
let message = (age < 3) ? 'Hi, baby!' :
  (age < 18) ? 'Hello!' :
  (age < 100) ? 'Greetings!' :
  'What an unusual age!';
alert( message );

same structure using else if:

if (age < 3) {
  message = 'Hi, baby!';
} else if (age < 18) {
  message = 'Hello!';
} else if (age < 100) {
  message = 'Greetings!';
} else {
  message = 'What an unusual age!';
}

Sometimes the question mark ? is used as a replacement for if:
let company = prompt('Which company created JavaScript?', '');
(company == 'Netscape') ?
   alert('Right!') : alert('Wrong.');

It’s not recommended to use the question mark operator in this way. Bcz its not easy to read though appealing.
Here is the same code using If
let company = prompt('Which company created JavaScript?', '');

if (company == 'Netscape') {
  alert('Right!');
} else {
  alert('Wrong.');
}

TEST / EXAM

##    Using the if..else construct, write the code which asks:
 ‘What is the “official” name of JavaScript?’
If the visitor enters “ECMAScript”, then output “Right!”, 
otherwise – output: “You don’t know? ECMAScript!”
Answer: 
let officialName = prompt('what is the "official" name of JS', "");
      if (officialName == "ECMAScript") {
        alert("Right");
      } else {
        alert("You don't know? ECMAScript!");
      }


##    Using if..else, write the code which gets a number via prompt and then shows in alert:
1, if the value is greater than zero,
-1, if less than zero,
0, if equals zero.
In this task we assume that the input is always a number.
let number = prompt("What is your number?", "");
  if (number < 0) {
  alert(-1);
  } else if (number == 0) {
  alert(0);
  } else if (number > 0) {
  alert(1);
}

##    Rewrite this if using the conditional operator '?':
let result;
if (a + b < 4) {
  result = 'Below';
} else {
  result = 'Over';
}

Answer: (improvised)
let a = +prompt("what is the value of a?", "");
let b = +prompt("what is the value of b?", "");
let result = a + b;
// alert(+result);
result < 4 ? alert("Below") : alert("over");

My answer:
let result = a+b;
result < 4? alert("below") : alert("over");    
website Sol: let result = (a + b < 4) ? 'Below' : 'Over';

##    Rewrite if..else using multiple ternary operators '?'.
      let message;
      if (login == 'Employee') {
        message = 'Hello';
      } else if (login == 'Director') {
        message = 'Greetings';
      } else if (login == '') {
        message = 'No login';
      } else {
        message = '';
      }


Answer: 
      let login = prompt("login", "");
      let message =
        login == "Employee"
          ? "Hello"
          : login == "Director"
          ? "Greetings"
          : login == ""
          ? "No login"
          : "Go to Hell";
      alert(message);


      Solution:

let message = (login == 'Employee') ? 'Hello' :
(login == 'Director') ? 'Greetings' :
(login == '') ? 'No login' :
'';


##    Write the code which asks for a login with prompt.
If the visitor enters "Admin", then prompt for a password,
if the input is an empty line or Esc – show “Canceled”,
if it’s another string – then show “I don’t know you”.

The password is checked as follows:
If it equals “master”, then show “Welcome!”,
Another string – show “Wrong password”,
For an empty string or cancelled input, show “Canceled”
##    Answer
let user = prompt("who's there?", "");
      if (user == "Admin") {
        let pass = prompt("password", "");
        if (pass == "master") {
          alert("Welcome!");
        } else if (pass == null || pass == "") {
          alert("cancelled");
        } else {
          alert("wrong password");
        }
      } else if (user == null || user == "") {
        alert("cancelled");
      } else {
        alert("I dont know you");
      }
